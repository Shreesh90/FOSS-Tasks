1. AI Wing -
  I have been into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning/Deep Learning for quite some time now and have keen interest on developing my knowledge regarding AI 
algorithms and their applications in present-day scenarios. I sincerely hope that I will be able to meet like-minded individuals with the same passion there and help me
grow and develop my interest further.

2. FOSS Wing -
  Open Source Development/Collaboration has always excited me. I am greatly interested in problem solving/algorithms. Moreover, I like working on a specific project with
teams to accomplish goals and I expect FOSS Wing to help me keep up with the ever-expanding and rapidly developing world of open-source software. I look forward to meeting
passionate people working on new ideas and intend to contribute to various organisations whilst working as a student cum developer.
