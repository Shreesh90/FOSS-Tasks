1. FOSS
Since I am a newbie in the world of programming, I had to start somewhere. FOSS seemed as good an option as any.
I hope to learn more about how open sources softwares work, and how people from the world over can contribute to your project.
Ihe idea of complete strangers coming together to optimize, augment or improve a program is fascinating.
I also hope this will help me improve my programming skills.

2. Web Development
It's common practice among beginners (or so I am led to believe) to pick either AppD or WebD.
I picked Web Development over App Development because I don't like small screens. Non-sensical reason? Yes. But works for me.
I expect this Wing to help me gain an insight into how websites are developed at the back end as well as the front end.
Crafting web pages is a skill which is bound to come in handy in the future.

3. Cyber Security
Thanks to an unhealthy helping of spy movies and Dan Brown novels, I have always been interested in cryptography.
All the different ways messages can be hidden in seemingly innocuous places spark a certain excitement in me.
Hopefully, by joining this Wing, I will learn more about the vast number of ways to encrypt messages, and about how white hat hackers work.

4. Competitive Coding
I mean, need I elaborate? It's CC.
