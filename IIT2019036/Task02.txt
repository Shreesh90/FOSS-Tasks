                       THE GEEKHAVEN ,THE TECHNICAL STRENGTH OF OUR COLLEGE

In this text file,I would like to lay emphasis on the GeekHaven Wings that I do like the most and what do I expect from them.


1.WEB DEVELOPMENT:

A lots of interests have imbibed in me regarding WEB D. I expect that this wing will certainly raise my interest to the next higher level making and helping me learn the basics of building of web pages , websites and working on a frontend as well as backend. 

2.FOSS

I have always listened to about contributing on an open source like GITHUB ,FEDORA,etc. But the fact is that the lack of knowledge about the usage of these sources is a major problem for me.So, I expect that the 'FOSS' wing will be helping me all the ways throughout which I am really feeling that the seniors are wholeheartedly contributing their maximum.

3.CC

I really love to code since the members of this society have embibed the culture of learning to code.I hereby even expect them to continue with the same practice.
